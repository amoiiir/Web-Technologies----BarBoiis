### Introduction

BarBois, is an organisation that focuses on maintaining the health and well-being of an individual through callisthenics. It is a term that associates exercises using only body weight and the environment around us to perform basic compound exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, dips or squats. Compared to heavy weight exercise, callisthenics are way cheaper and available almost all the time. People can still do their workouts anywhere either at the park, the beach or even at home, as long as they have the right knowledge and equipment to achieve their desired goals in fitness.

The goal of our website is to help people understand the basics of exercising at any age level. The website consists of Introduction to bodyweight exercises a.k.a callisthenics, simple to follow workout programs, common equipment to help in exercising and nearby training areas. We aim to make a comprehensible website that delivers the easiest concepts of bodyweight exercises to the users which also includes the design and interface of the website itself. 

The sources that are available inside the website will be cited to the original authors and creators since it will be inspired heavily from YouTube, research papers, google scholars and other relevant sources on the internet. Extra features will be included inside the website such as donations for our club community around Selangor, booking sessions with certified coaches and organising competitions for anyone to showcase their strength and talents.

The hope of creating this club is to achieve SDG goal number 3, Good Health and Well-Being which is to promote a healthy lifestyle among IIUM students through exercising. Exercising does not only help us physically, but also emotionally as well to maintain our body in a great condition all the time.
